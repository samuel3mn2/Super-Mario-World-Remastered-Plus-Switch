<h1 align="center">Super Mario World Remastered Plus · Nintendo Switch port</h1>

A wrapper/loader that runs the **Android release of Super Mario World
Remastered Plus** (a fully open-source fan game by [BTFighter](https://github.com/BTFighter/Super-Mario-World-Remastered-Plus/releases/tag/v1.1), built on **Godot
4.4**) on the Nintendo Switch. It loads the original `arm64-v8a`
`libgodot_android.so`, provides a minimal Android-like environment (fake JNI,
a bionic→newlib libc shim, and a GLES3/EGL import table backed by mesa), and
drives the engine's `GodotLib` native lifecycle directly.

### How to install

On your SD card, the app lives in `/switch/smwr_nx/`:

```
/switch/smwr_nx/smwr.nro              <- the port (this repo builds it)
/switch/smwr_nx/libgodot_android.so   <- arm64-v8a engine binary (from the APK)
/switch/smwr_nx/libc++_shared.so      <- arm64-v8a C++ runtime (from the APK)
/switch/smwr_nx/assets/               <- game data (the APK's assets/ folder)
/switch/smwr_nx/save/baserom.sfc      <- your legally own Super Mario World dump.
```

Both `.so` files must be the **arm64-v8a** ones (`lib/arm64-v8a/` inside the
APK) — not the armeabi-v7a ones.

Launch it through a **game/title override** (hold R on a game and open it) or a
forwarder, so the port runs with full RAM. It will not work in applet/album mode.

Saves and `config.txt` live in `/switch/smwr_nx/save/`.

### Local multiplayer

The port exposes up to eight independently connected Switch controllers to
Godot. Connect every player from the Switch controller screen before starting
the game; each controller is delivered to the game as a separate Godot input
device. Handheld mode and the first paired controller remain player one.

Single Joy-Con controllers are supported horizontally. On the left Joy-Con,
the stick is rotated for movement, Minus is Start, and SL/SR act as L/R. On
the right Joy-Con, the stick is rotated for movement and SL/SR act as L/R.

### How to build

You need devkitA64 (devkitPro) with these packages:

* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-zlib`

Then, from the **devkitPro msys2 shell**:

```sh
make
```

`assets/` from the fan game's APK. The fan game itself is open source (ISC) at
